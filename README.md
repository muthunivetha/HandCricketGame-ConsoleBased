# HandCricketGame-ConsoleBased

This is a Simple console based Hand Cricket logic using Java.

Hand Cricket is a game played between 2 people. They gesture numbers 0,1,2,3,4 & 6 with their fingers in a random manner. A game consists of two rounds. Each round is played until the player batting gets out or a maximum of 6 throws is reached. 

Game result:
The player with the highest score at the end of both rounds is the winner. In case the scores are level, it is a tie. 						

Write an application that simulates the random gestures of the players and prints the game summary along with the winner.
